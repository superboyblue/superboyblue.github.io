			<h2>bio</h2>
<p>
I was born in New York City to immigrant parents who came here for a better life. They raised me and my older brother in a tiny studio apartment with a heater that didn't work in the winter but blazed in the summer. The landlord was a tyrant of a man who was always after the rent early but never on time with repairs. My parents would later tell me that he was involved with the mob and that's why he always needed cash. But that was Brooklyn back then, that was home. 
</p>
<p>
We moved out of there a few years later, back before my memories were my own but instead hand me downs of anecdotes and inside jokes that I never really got but always felt a part of. And that's how I felt about everything that was someone else's first. My favorite sweater was my cousin Ben's. My only toy car once belonged to our new neighor's son, and he'd already crashed most of the paint off the corners. The apartment we ended up in was vacated by an uncle who gave it to us, and even with the wallpaper peeling at the corners, the linoleum floors with patches missing and revealing yet another layer of older, more worn down linoleum, it was ours, and that was all that mattered. 
</p>
<p>
I don't remember much of those early years; maybe all the happy, carfree days of being a kid melded into an extended summer vacation, punctuated by life that was always full stop. Your parents are splitting up. Full stop. They both came to pick you up from school on the same day. Full stop. They each grab a hand and try to pull in seprate directions, comma splice. Your grandmother died. Full stop. 
</p>
<p>
And then it was turmoil being chased out of the only home I knew as my own by hostile homeowners who didn't think a single mom with two boys could possibly make ends meet to cover rent on time so we went far enough away that we didn't have to run into them but close enough for me to still long for my old bunk bed with a window that faced my school yard so on days when I was too sick to go to school or my dad had forgotten to take me, I could hear the kids playing at recess and wonder what it would be like if I was there. 
</p>
<p>
But it was a new school and a new life and a new home and everything new and I wanted so bad to have my old things again, the sneakers with the two velcro straps that my cousin had grown out of and that I had to leave behind barely worn, the yard where someone else had planted a pear tree that we would throw fallen fruit at to get even more fallen fruit. The door frame that had my name next to some other kid's with equally bad handwriting, measuring heights and ages so that I'd have someone to compete with that was my age. I knew there wasn't any turning back as much as I wanted to, because my story was about to get started.

<h2>Something Quirky</h2>
<br>
I have two inflatable dinosaurs that keep me company when I code. And also when I'm watching TV. 
<br>
They're actually just always around. I try talking to them sometimes but they're airheads. 
<br>
But I know they'll always be there for me to keep me afloat in case the flood waters come.
