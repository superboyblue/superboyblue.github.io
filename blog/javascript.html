    <h4>documenting differences</h4>

<p>
Ruby's official documentation page is clunky, bare bone, and hard to navigate at times. It has all its releases in one place and at times can look like craigslist.  When compared to the javascript reference material on Mozilla's, it looks down right dated. 
</p>
<p>
But Ruby's documentation is a labor of love! The main documentation page has all the quirky little things that we've come to know and love about Ruby, from free Ruby tutorials to Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby! It's all you'll need to start your learning and love for Ruby all in one place. Sure, it may not be the prettiest, or the most polished, or even the most fancy. But it's ours! And it definitely feels like the little guy. Who doesn't like an underdog story, right?
</p>
In contrast, Mozilla's javascript reference has graphics with drop shadows and fades, a demo page that is interactive and extremely attractive, has different styling elements for every page you navigate to, and feels more expensive, more important, more corporate. 
</p>
In the end, they're both still highly informative and extremely essential for both communities. They're both open source where anyone can contribute, and have active communities for people to share ideas and information. And they're both still growing and evolving as languages and communities, so hopefully the documentation pages will continue to grow as well.
