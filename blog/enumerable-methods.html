.each_slice is a handy little enumerable method that does exactly what it sounds like it
<br> 
does, it slices, it dices! It makes everything tiny and managable. 
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Say you give it a number, any number like... 10. And you want to slice it up into parts. 
<br>
We'll say teams of 3. And then there's a number left all by itself. It sucks to be in your 
<br>
own little slice sometimes. Unless it's pie. Then those people in teams have to share a 
<br>
slice amongst the 3 of them and you can have your own little slice to yourself. 
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
And if you want to slice an array? You can do that. Just give it an array of whatever   
<br>
you want, and it'll slice it into arrays with the number of elements you specified. Pass it 
<br>
in a block and it'll print out all your slices. Pretty neat, huh? If it isn't evenly 
<br>
divisible, the remaining elements will once again be put in the final slice.

It works on hashes, too. With a block, the same rules apply. It'll split your hash into 
<br>
arrays of the number that you wanted, putting the remainders in the final slice. The arrays 
<br>
themselves contain the key and value pair of the hash element.

There's also this thing where if you don't give it a code block and just a number, it'll 
<br>
return an enumerator and you need to use the .next method to see your slices but that's not 
<br>
really too helpful right now so we won't get into it. Until next time!
