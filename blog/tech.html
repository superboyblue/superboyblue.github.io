    <h4>What's your type?</h4>
<p>
Static typed languages are languages that type check during compile time versus run time, whereas a dynamic typed language does the majority of type checking at run time. So what does that mean exactly? 
</p>
<p>
I guess the first thing is to explain what a type system is. This is essentially the rule book for assigning a property to anything in a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. So what is it for? It pretty much tries to keep everything clean and consistent, by reducing bugs in programs. It does this by defining interfaces between the different parts of a program and checking to see that they've been connected properly. 
</p>
<p>
So if that still doesn't make any sense to you, you aren't alone. I didn't get it either. So maybe we can try simplifying it a bit, for my sake.
</p>
<p>
Let's say C is a neighborhood in a city with its own set of laws and economy. And one of the rules for C is that they deal with a certain currency for a certain transaction. So maybe you're buying a house in C and want to pay it for it? They can only take C notes. But if you're buying fish from the market? C shells only. So if you took a C note to the market and tried to get some fish, what would happen? They would stop you before you even got to the register to tell you that you've got the wrong type of currency! So you go back to go get the C shells and all is forgiven. It's lucky they stopped you as you piled into the queue, otherwise you would have mucked it up. 
</p>
<p>
So now we're walking into the hip new neighborhood called JS. Their main currency is scripts, but they'll take just about anything and barter with you. But then you won't necessarily get what you wanted. So you walk to the store, you've got some scripts and you're trying to get some books, but this particular shop said that they prefer getting beans, but you figure beans and scripts, what's the difference. So you pick out all your books, queue up, and when you get to the register, they hand you some salami. But the guy in front of you got what he came for using scripts. What gives? Well, he happened to want salami. But that's not what you asked for, that's not what you came for, that's not even what you brought to the register. So now you're standing there trying to retrace some steps to where things went wrong and every step of the way, things seemed to be going alright. It wasn't until you got to the very end did you realize that maybe there was something up with that. But then you realize that you missed the sign outside on the window that said that they prefer beans and so now you go back to get beans and buy your books and go merrily on your way.
<p>
So what does that tell us about static and dynamic typed languages?
</p>
<p>
Static typed languages will throw you errors very early on and very specifically before anything really has a chance to get processed. It's very unforgiving in this regard. But I hear it makes for better pseudocode because everything needs to be very well thought out and intentional. 
</p>
<p>
Dynamic type will probably let you get away with a few things and is generally more liberal with what they take. You could probably skip a thing or two here and there and still get the intended output, no harm, no foul. I think that makes learning more approachable and even a little fun.
