      The benefits of version control is that it allows for incremental progress to be saved and revisited at a later date for posterity, research, finding the names of the programmers who worked on a specific piece of code, when they did it, and why. You may be asking yourself how a regular person would benefit from this kind of thing? Well, let us say for this example that something was sent back in time to do something. With version control, they could quickly compile a list of names and dates to visit and so stop something bad. Or maybe there's a bug in the software that needs looking at and no one really understands what's going on so they can go back to specific versions and start again from there.

        Git helps keep track of changes by allowing commits, which are snapshots of code as you go. They're the save points in this text based rpg that allow you to go back to that moment right before your entire party is slain so that you can equip the proper commands to make sure it goes off without a hitch.

       Github is the perfect place to store your code because it allows for remote access, shared access, and a simple and clean way of tracking software history. You can recruit others in your quest to find the perfect code, or at least the working code, you can see what work others have done and keep changes, merge them, use them as guidance, what have you. It's the puffy little cloud that you can store your code so when you're on the go or your partner needs a look but is in Tokyo or something, you can have instant access.
