  <h2>So you're bordering on padding margins...</h2>

      So you must be wondering to yourself, "How did I get here?" I suppose it had something to do with your interest in borders (hopefully not the geographical kind, because you're definitely in the wrong place), padding (it's the soft fluffy stuff that protects your preciouses) or margins (those are the spaces in between, separating our borders, sort of like a DMZ except with less landmines).

      If you're still reading at this point, you either really mean to be here or you've been drawn in by my humourous asides or you're too lazy to click away. Either way, it's time to get down to some explaining.
      What's a border? Well, a border is an imaginary line around your content that isn't so imaginary because you can change its color and size. you can make it a solid line, or little dashes to trace out whatever shape your content is taking. So what's the border separate? Your content from the outside world! You wouldn't want it spilling out into other content, would you? No, sir! That's why it's all kept safely in the borders, away from the prying eyes and shifty hands of other content that's lingering about. Say you've got a photo that needs a nice little border, just to give it some contrast. It can be as narrow or as wide as you want! It's essentially framing the picture. Looks a lot better, doesn't it? Definitely beats taping up a picture of your children to your wall or using push pins. That's just tacky. So now that you have a frame for your photo, maybe you decide you want a larger frame, or maybe you want to class it up a little with a white window mat. That's where padding comes in! It puts space in between the frame and that picture of little Timmy in his Totoro costume. With the padding, you'll look like a parent with sophisiticated taste and a strong appreciation for homages to miyazaki films. But wait! You have two kids! And your daughter Jenny looks just as adorable dressed as a Gundam. So you put up a picture of her, next to Timmy's. But do you stick the frames together side by side like some kind of savage with no sense of spacing or maybe someone who just has too much stuff and too little wall? No! That's where margins come in. You want to give both pictures enough space from each other so that they may be admired separately but equally, and far enough away from the post it notes from your coworker in the neighboring cube telling you that your typing is too loud and his creating a hostile work environment. There you have it!

      To review:
      -Borders are the picture frames around pictures of your darling children.
      
      -Padding is the mat window you use to make it look fancy (the white paper thing inside of the frame that also frames the photo)
      
      -Margins are the personal space for your photos so they don't feel cluttered by cubical complaints
