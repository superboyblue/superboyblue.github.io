    <h4>Classing it up</h4>

<p>
So you want to make a class? That's cool. We could alluse a little bit of class every now and then. So what is a class anyway? Well, it's essentially a blue print of something that there's going to be a bunch of. 
</p>
<p>
Say you like bikes. I'm sorry, bicycles. I forgot that we're trying to be fancy. So you like bicycles and want to make a bicycle class.
</p>
So you start out with:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
There, you've done it! But you're wondering what's the point? well, a bike does more than just ride. It also has to stop. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
You're probably wondering what all the point of that is? Why can't you just make a ride and brake method and be done? Well, think about your bicycles for a second. And now think about all the ones out there. What if you want to have a road bike? That would fit into the class of bicycles and you would only need to update some minor data. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="\imgs\class-screenshotthird.png">

<br>
<br>
<p>
So you get something like that going with an instance variable, so you can use it through all your methods. An instance variable can be used throughout the instance of the class. So your road bike will be a road bike the entire time you call on braking or riding. Your brakes would be a local variable. It would be type_of_bike dependent since you don't want monster 9" hydraulic disc brakes on your 2 lb carbon frame.
