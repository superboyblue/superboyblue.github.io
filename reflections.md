Q:  What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

A:  I learned that padding, borders and margins are very important when it comes to positioning and making content look good. Without proper framing, any content (with exceptions) wouldn't look as good.

Q:  What did you learn about CSS positioning?

A:  I learned a lot about floating, relative positions, fixed, absolute, and how difficult it is to get everything to look the way you want it to. I also learned that I have a lot to learn about CSS positioning.

Q:  What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

A:  The easiest aspects I found were the fonts and borders and things. Those were fun to play around with. Each semantic element in itself was really fun to style. The hardest part for me was layout. It never wanted to stay put or go where I wanted it to.

Q:  What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

A: I learned that it's very easy to lose track of time wanting to move something a few pixels here and there and then having it over lap things. I also learned that semantic tags makes it much easier to keep track of what's what and wrapping things in class or ID tags really makes it easy to pinpoint an individual element for styling.
