  	These projects are all my of my own creation. If anything looks similar to anything else, it's either derivative, fair use, or used in a mocking manner. I'm a satirist. Not a very good one. But I do what I can. And a lot of the times what I can't. As evidenced by this poor excuse for a project page. But I'm working on it. It itself is the project.
